1. In general, why would you even want to join tow (or more) tables together? 
   This is a good time to think about the nature of relational algebra.
   You need more than one table to get what you want.
 
2. Describe in your own words the output from an inner join.
   Rows that are identical in both tables.

3. Describe in your own words the output from an _outer join_.
   An outer join’s returns differ based on if it is LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL. 
   
4. Describe in your own words the output from a _cross join_.
   A cross join returns a Cartesian Product each row from one table is matched with every 
   row in the other table.

5. A convenient mnemonic for remembering the various joins is "Ohio." Why is this true?
   Ohio is higher in the middle. There is one type of cross join, one type of inner join,
   but three types of outer joins (left, right, full).

6. Give an example of a composite join.
   A composite join would be select C.name, O.number from sales.customers. 

7. What is the difference between the following two queries? The business problem is 
   "How many orders do we have from each customer?"
   The first won't because it will be counting the customers, whether they placed an 
   order or not. The second only counts the orders that were actually placed and returns the correct results.
 
8. What might be one reason the following query does not return the column custID in this query?
   If no orders had an orderdate on or after ‘20160101’.
