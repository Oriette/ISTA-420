1. What does a set operator do?  
   They combine rows from two query result sets.

2.What are the general requirements of a set operator?  
  Input Query1
  <set_operator>
  Input Query2
  [ORDER BY ...]; 
 
3.What is a Venn Diagram? This is not in the book.  
  A Venn diagram is a diagram that shows all possible logical relations
  between a finite collection of different sets.

4.Draw a Venn Diagram of the UNION operator. What does it do?  
  The UNION operator unifies the results of two input queries. 

5.Draw a Venn Diagram of the UNION ALL operator. What does it do?  
  The UNION ALL operator unifies the two input query results without attempting
  to remove duplicates from the result. 

6.Draw a Venn Diagram of the INTERSECT operator. What does it do?  
  The INTERSECT operator returns only the rows that are common to the results of the two input queries.

7.If SQL Server supported the INTERSECT ALL operator, what would it do?
  Code sample
  SELECT ProductID FROM Product INTERSECT
  SELECT ProductID FROM WorkOrder;
  SELECT ProductID FROM Product EXCEPT
  SELECT ProductID FROM WorkOrder;

8.Draw a Venn Diagram of the EXCEPT operator. What does it do?  
  The EXCEPT operator returns only distinct rows that appear in the first set but 
  not the second. In other words, a row is returned once in the output as long as it 
  appears at least once in the first input multiset and zero times in the second.

9.If SQL Server supported the EXCEPT ALL operator, what would it do?
  Returns distinct rows by comparing the results of two queries. 
  EXCEPT returns distinct rows from the left input query that aren’t output by the right input query. 
  INTERSECT returns distinct rows that are output by both the left and right input queries operator.

10.What is the precedence of the set operators?  
   The precedence of the set operators is the INTERSECT operator precedes UNION and 
   EXCEPT, and UNION and EXCEPT are evaluated in order of appearance. Using the ALL variant 
   doesn’t change the precedence.
