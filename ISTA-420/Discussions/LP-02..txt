 - Nullability is "ALL" values  and they "must be known."

3. What is a unique constraint? What does it prevent? 
 - A Unique Contraint stops columns from storing duplicate data.

4. What is a foreign key constraint? What does it allow?
 - The "Key" enforces referential integrity.

5. What is a check constraint? What does it allow?
 - Figures out if the row is able to be in the table or not.

 - Doamin integrity means that all columns in relational databases must be declared. 

8. What is the difference between the where and the having clauses? How are they alike?
 - Where applies to a filter row. Having applies to a filter to groups. They both filter the "results."
