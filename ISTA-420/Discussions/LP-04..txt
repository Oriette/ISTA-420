1. What is a data type? Why do we have data types?
  Is a particular kind of data item. Uses the "right" data type can optimize the system.

2. What is a collation? Name four elements of a collation.
  Collation is a property of character data, like case sensitivity.

3. How would you strip whitespace from a string? For example? suppose you had
   Dave " but you only wanted "Dave".
   Use a combination of LeftTRIM and RightTRIM.

4. Suppose you wanted to make a list of every college and university that was
   called an Institute from the college table. Write the query.
   select name from college where name like "institute";

5. How would you find out the index of the first space in a string? For example,
   the index of the first space in "Barack Hussein Obama" would be 7.
    Use "CHARINDEX"

6. How would you select just the first name in a list of the presidents? First 
   names can be an arbitrary length, from "cal" to "Benjamin".
   By combination of LeftTrim and CHARINDEX.

7. Payments are due exactly 30 day from the date of the last function. Write a 
   select query that calculates the date of the next payment. Pretend we want to 
   update a column in a database that contains the date of the next payment. We will
   do this when we write UPDATE queries.
   select datead(day, 30, orderdate) as nextpayment from orders;

8. Suppose your son or daughter wants to run a query every day that tells them 
   the number of days until their 16th birthday. Qrite a select query that does this.
   "select datediff(day, getdate(), dateof16thbirthday);"

9. What function returns the current date? This is very useful in a table that 
   maintains a log of events, such as user logins.
   "Getdate()"
